<h1> Sure, here are some general guidelines for creating content for the body of a website:</h1> 
<p>2. **Images**: If you have an image-heavy page (like a photo gallery), then the photos are the main body content⁶.
  3. **Audio and Visual Elements**: Web content can and should also include audio and visual elements to provide additional elements for your audience to interact with. Audio and visual content for your website may include recordings, podcasts, videos, infographics, images, and photos².
  4. **Blogs**: Blog posts are often short—around 750 words—and are designed to inform, entertain, and delight your readers².
  5. **Case Studies**: Brands can use case studies to illustrate their value proposition by writing about how their product or service helped a customer or client².
  6. **Checklists**: Often downloadable, checklists are fantastic pieces of lead generation content, content that aims to attract potential new clients².
  7. **Ebooks**: Ebooks are long-form writing packaged into a book, generally in PDF format².</p>
  <h2>1. **Text**: Text makes up the majority of web content. It can include blog posts, marketing copy, and more¹².

    8. **Website Copy**: Content that appears on pages of your website like a homepage, landing page, about page, or FAQ².
    9. **White Papers**: Shorter than ebooks, these pieces of content generally focus on one specific topic or problem and offer solutions or data to solve the issue².
    
    Remember, good website content is content that has been optimized for search engines. Search engine optimization (SEO) drives traffic to websites through organic search results on search engines such as Google². 
    
    I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions.</h2>
